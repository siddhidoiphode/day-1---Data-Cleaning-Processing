# day 1 - Data-Cleaning-Processing
Data-set : netflix movies and tv shows (from kaggle)

Steps I took to clean data :
1. Find null values 7 replace with word as N/A , Unknown
2. Find duplicate value and delete
3. Date converted in dd-mm-yyyy format
4. specific data type to each column
5. rename the column if needed
6. used theme foe easier fidings and attractive dataset
7. to trim white spaces used =Trim(column_name_row_numb) function

It helped me to get hands on experience on excel and learning new things.
